This is the new communication and transport protocol, called CTP_DEVS.
1. MD255 checksum (1 bit reserved)
2. 3-part body (128-bit encoded)
3. C/C++ languages ​​for Ahead and Head; also for the body of the tree parts.
4. The queue must be programmed in Java.
5. Frames must be connected via a SQL trigger to the Oracle database using Python code.
6. All backups must have access to cloud networks.
***
What is the task of this CTP_DEVS?
1. Verify that all packets are properly populated.
2. Collaborate with all other protocols.
3. Processing time and quality of service.
4. Cover all networks in the OSI model. 5. Control the origin, quality, type, and integrity of all information.
***
Why use CTP_DEVS? 
1. Regulate the use of broadcast space in the air, water, or ground (surface and deep)
2. Avoid collisions between information packets
3. Avoid noise, signal distortion, and lip synchronization between voice and image
4. Facilitate the role of routers in the concentration and correct encapsulation of information
5. Safeguard the origin of frames and reduce dissipation costs everywhere
6. Everything has its order, sequence, frequencies, and algorithm
7. The CTP_DEVS protocol will facilitate architecture and exchange between existing applications and will be carried out through VPN tunnels according to the OSI Model based on TCP/IP V4, transcribed in parallel on TCP/IP V6
